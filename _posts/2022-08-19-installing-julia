# Installing Julia and VSCode

### Windows
Please download and install Julia as explained at https://julialang.org/downloads/ .
Choose the 64-bit (installer). Make sure to check the option "Add julia to path" when running the installer.
For advanced users it is suggested also to install [git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) which also includes the `bash` command line interface, which is very useful for small automation tasks. The git version control system keeps track of the changes of your files and allows the SW development in a team.

It is suggested to launch Julia from the command line, using either the "Windows command prompt" or "bash" by typing `julia` or `julia --project` (if you work with projects). If you never used a command prompt before, read the [Beginners Guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/).

### Linux

Copy and past the following line to install the latest stable version of Julia:
```
bash -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abelsiqueira/jill/master/jill.sh)"
```
If you want to be able to easily switch between different versions of Julia consider to install
the Python version of jill, see https://github.com/johnnychen94/jill.py
```bash
pip install jill --user -U
jill install 1.7
```
If you should later install version 1.8 with `jill install 1.8` you can then switch between the versions with `jill switch 1.7` etc.

It is suggested to add the following line to your ```.bashrc``` file:
```
alias jl='./bin/run_julia'
```
This makes it possible to run julia with the shortcut `jl` later, if you have a `run_julia` script in the `bin` folder of your projects. I suggest to use such a script, the most simple version of it would just contain the line `julia --project` . 

### Mac
Please download and install Julia as explained at https://julialang.org/downloads/

The jill installers will most likely also work on Mac and allow easy switching of different Julia versions (see Linux section).

## Installation of the IDE VSCode
It is useful to install the integrated development environment VSCode, even though it is not
required. You can also use any editor of your choice. 

VSCode provides syntax highlighting, but also the feature "goto definition" which can help to understand
and explore the code.

You can download and install VSCode for all operating systems from this location: https://code.visualstudio.com/

For Ubuntu Linux the following ppa can be used to install vscode and to keep it up-to-date: [https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppa/vscode](https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppa/vscode) .

Julia development with VSCode is well documented here: https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/stable/

I would NOT use all the advanced features of julia-vscode, I prefer to just use the vscode terminal and launch julia
from the terminal. This makes it easy to launch Julia with any command line options and also to start
and restart Julia quickly.
