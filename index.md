## Julia
[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is the most beautiful programming language ever, as easy as Python and as fast as C.

In this blog I want to share some of my experiances in solving technical problems
with Julia.

## About myself
I did a PhD in airborne wind energy at Delft University of Technology, was working at
at ABB in Delft, The Netherlands on chargers for electric cars. Since 2023 I am back
at TU Delft as postdoc, working on "Physics informed learning control of wind energy systems".

My main interests are renewable energies, control engineering, philosophy and music.
